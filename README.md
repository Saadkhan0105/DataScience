# Variables:
- A variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. Think of it as a container for data.
- We can create a variable using the assignment operator =.
- Example: 
```
name = "Saad"
age = 28
is_learning = True
```
Here:

	•	name is a variable storing a string.
	•	age stores an integer.
	•	is_learning stores a Boolean value.

- We don’t need to declare the type explicitly Python is dynamically typed.

# DataTypes:
- Python has several built in data types, grouped as follows: 

## 1. Text Type:
- str → String of characters
- Example: "Hello"
